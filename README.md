OpenFanControl
==============

This is an open source automotive fan controller. I was not pleased with the cost and inflexibility of COTS controllers and their incompatibility with certain fans. So I designed my own. The code is designed to be easily modified with the variables. It includes an algorithm of a sort to trim the fan speed to maintain a constant speed and the engine at a set temperature.
